# UBER-data-analysis
Uber ride data insights with Power BI visualization and ML prediction of booking/cancellation trends. 
This repository contains an end-to-end analysis of NCR Uber ride booking data. The dataset consists of Uber ride booking records in CSV format.

Key highlights of the project:

📊 Data Analysis: Performed using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and other visualization tools.

🤖 Machine Learning Models: Implemented multiple models to predict ride outcomes (e.g., bookings and cancellations) and evaluated their performance through accuracy comparison.

📈 Visualizations: Insights presented using both Python plots and an interactive Power BI dashboard for better trend analysis.

🔍 Focus Areas: Revenue trends, total bookings, cancellations, and other customer behavior patterns.

This project demonstrates the integration of data preprocessing, ML model evaluation, and visualization techniques for extracting meaningful insights from ride-booking data.
